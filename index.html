								ATOMS has observed 146 active star-forming regions with ALMA band 3, aiming to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers 
								in a large sample of Galactic massive clumps, to study the roles of stellar feedback in star formation, and to characterize filamentary structures inside massive clumps.
								In the Cycle 8 and 9, the ATOMS extended the observations of ALMA band 6. <br>
